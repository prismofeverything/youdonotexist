<h4 style="margin-left:-20px">In August I got some text messages ---</h4>
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  Has anyone contacted you about me?  i had to tell you i was leaving Someone has put a hit out for me.  I dont deserve it.  I need help and i need you to be honest.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben (an hour later):  I understand.  By help i just meant i needed to know if u were contacted or not.  Thats it.  I will always love you and what you stand for.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me:  No one has contacted me.  If I can do anything for you let me know.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  I dont know if this is needed or not.  But I love you man and dont want anything to happen to you.  Change your phone number just to be completely safe.
	  </p>
	  <p>
<h4 style="margin-left:-20px">Now in the last day or so...</h4>
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  i dont know whats going on
	  </p>
	  <p>
my own family colluded with some kind of all powerful cabal to ruin my life for no reason.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me:  Dude, what happened?  And unless these people can create new stars or something they are not all powerful.  That is the first test.  The next is making a network flow maximizer that runs in linear time.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  I think they can do those things. I think they have telepathy as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  you don't believe me do you? I wouldn't think that anyone would.
	  </p>
	  <p>
<h4 style="margin-left:-20px">I asked him what happened ----</h4>
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  I don't know if I can describe to you what has happened.
All I can say is what I know, which is that my family is in collusion with some all powerful cabal and together they have devised an elaborate scheme to ruin my life for no reason. I haven't done anything to anyone, and of course I would never do anything to a relative. You know, or I think you would know that I would never do anything egregious to anyone without reason. This is all I know.
 
You can choose to belief me or not.
 
I did not think you, or anyone, would believe that an all powerful cabal with telepathic powers has turned all the members of my immediate family into automatons determined to ruin my life.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  there was a typo in that last message.
 
I meant to type You can choose to have belief in me or not.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me:  Yes, I choose to believe you.  I do not think you are lying to me, or would ever need to lie to me.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben: I'm not lying to you. My family has and is ruining my life for no reason. They seem to be under the conrol of some all powerful enitity. Unless they are just simply evil and woke up one day and decided they wanted to ruin my life.
 
They have prevented me from being at my best. They have prevented me from being myself. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me: Are you living at home right now, or are you still in brazil?
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben: I'm on long island.
 
My family has ruined my life for no reason.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me:  Wait how is your life ruined?  Last I knew you were in brazil.  I don't even know what you've been up to or anything.  What have you been up to?How did the brazil thing go?  
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  I can't tell you everything. You wouldn't believe me anyway.
 
Nothing makes any sense. I haven't done anything to anyone.  Despite the fact I have always been good to my family, and they are the ones who have not returned the kindness and love, they have colluded with some all powerful cabal to ruin my life for no reason.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Me:  Dude, try me!  My capacity to believe stuff is actually infinite.  I don't care how wacky it sounds, dude who are you talking to?  The wackier the better.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
Ben:  I can't tell you because I don't know what these people are capable of or what else they might do to me, although I haven't done anything to anyone. It appears that they are just determined to ruin my life for no reason and judging from what they have already done for no reason I don't want to take any chances in that regard.
 
I hope that you never know what it feels like to be betrayed by your own family. 
 
They are all acting like complete psychos for reasons they won't explain. It is debilitating me psychologically. Your family is supposed to love and support you, not plot elaborate schemes to ruin your life for no reason. I can barely concentrate or focus on anything.
